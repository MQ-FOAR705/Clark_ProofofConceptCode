This publically available code requires the user to edit the code to include their own API key and authenticate with the server. Once they have done authentication, they must replace the values in the code with their unique, secret set of keys and secrets.

Once that has completed:
1. Install required packages (oauth, oauth2, numpy).
2. Run __main__.py
3. Get a cup of coffee and wait about 50 minutes for completion.
